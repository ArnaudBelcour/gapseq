# Prediction of domain (Bacteria/Archaea) via HMM profiles

The files stored in this directory contains the required data to infer the organism's domain (Bacteria/Archaea) from the input genome sequence. To this end, the file `domain.hmm.gz` contains HMM profiles of orthologous protein-coding genes (amino acid sequence) that are either indicative for Bacteria or Archaea. The assignment of HMM-profile to the specific domain is retrieved from [GTDBtk](https://github.com/Ecogenomics/GTDBTk) (package version R207_v2).
